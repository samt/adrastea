This IRC bot is written to complile with the GNU CCompiler (GCC), 
i.e. It will not work on windows. This bot does not have features
fully implemented yet, and it will not work properly as it is. It
was designed to be a lightweight, multi-purpose bot.

All configuration options are in sample.bot.conf, rename it to 
bot.conf and ensure it sits in the same directory as the exceutable.
The modules directory must be present, as many operations will be
based entirely on them.

Todo List:
- Implement proper modules

Future:
- Listen on an port for telnet connections
